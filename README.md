# 2. Research and Brainstorming

## 2.1 Research Approach

Our team began by identifying real problems we experience in our daily lives and areas where we believed technology could provide a useful solution.

We brainstormed several ideas and evaluated each one based on the problem it addresses, its target users, existing solutions, technical feasibility, and potential for future development.

For each idea, we also considered whether similar products or platforms already exist. When existing solutions were found, we looked for possible improvements or gaps that could make our idea different.

This process helped us compare different concepts and identify the idea that best matched our team's interests, skills, and project timeline.

## 2.2 Brainstorming Methods

We used the following brainstorming approaches:

* **Mind Mapping:** We started with common problems and expanded them into possible technology-based solutions.
* **Group Discussion:** Each team member proposed ideas and explained the problem, target users, and possible features.
* **Problem-Based Brainstorming:** We focused on problems we personally observed rather than starting with a specific technology.
* **Competitor Research:** We searched for existing solutions to understand what already exists and identify possible gaps.
* **Feasibility Discussion:** We discussed whether each idea could realistically be developed by four developers within the project timeline.

## 2.3 Ideas Explored


| **Idea** | **Description** | **Strengths** | **Weaknesses / Challenges** | **Decision** | **Reason for Decision** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **FocusRobot** | A physical robot paired with a mobile app that helps users maintain focus during study or work sessions. The robot uses a camera and Computer Vision to monitor focus-related behaviors and provides feedback and rewards. | Combines Computer Vision, mobile development, hardware, and gamification. It provides an opportunity to build a physical prototype and has potential for future expansion. | Computer Vision accuracy, hardware integration, privacy concerns, and limited development time. | **Selected** | The idea combines current technologies such as AI, Computer Vision, and robotics. It also provides a challenging project that allows the team to learn new technologies and build a physical prototype. |
| **ArSL** | A real-time Arabic Sign Language interpreter for meetings that converts spoken language into Arabic Sign Language. | Addresses an important accessibility problem and has potential social impact. | Integration with existing meeting platforms such as Zoom, Teams, and Meet could create adoption and technical challenges. | Rejected | Similar solutions already exist, which makes it more difficult for the project to provide a sufficiently different or unique solution. |
| **Masar** | A platform for discovering activities in Saudi Arabia and creating personalized itineraries based on user preferences. | Useful for people looking for activities, potentially budget-friendly, and can provide personalized recommendations. | Similar platforms and services already exist, making differentiation more difficult. | Rejected | Similar platforms and services already exist, so the team felt it would be difficult to provide enough differentiation from existing solutions. |
| **Hackathon Platform** | A platform for discovering hackathons and finding suitable teammates based on skills and interests. | Useful for students and developers interested in hackathons and could include team matching. | Finding reliable and consistent hackathon data and building a useful matching system within the project timeline could be challenging. | Rejected | The idea was considered feasible, but the team preferred FocusRobot because it is more challenging and provides more opportunities to explore hardware, AI, and robotics. |
| **Team-Based Word Game** | A multiplayer team-vs-team Arabic word game inspired by category-based games. Players compete in teams by answering word or knowledge challenges under time limits, with different rounds and scoring mechanics. | Simple and engaging concept, suitable for multiplayer, encourages teamwork and competition, and can be expanded with different game modes and challenges. | Similar word and category games already exist, making differentiation more difficult. Multiplayer synchronization and game balancing would also add development complexity. | Rejected | The idea was considered too simple compared with the team's goal of building a more challenging project that allows them to learn and apply new technologies. |

# 3. Idea Evaluation

# 4. Selected MVP Concept

## 4.1 MVP Summary

### FocusRobot

FocusRobot is a **physical desktop robot paired with a mobile application** designed to help users maintain focus during study or work sessions.

The user starts a focus session through the application and selects a target duration. During the session, the robot uses a camera and Computer Vision techniques to detect focus-related behaviors such as face presence, eye state, and head orientation.

The system converts these observations into simple focus states such as:

* `FOCUSED`
* `DISTRACTED`
* `AWAY`

The robot provides visual feedback through a small screen displaying different facial expressions.

After successfully completing a focus session, the user receives rewards such as XP or coins. These rewards can later be used to customize the robot with different clothes, accessories, and other items.

The MVP will focus on a simple physical prototype rather than a complex moving robot. The body can be 3D printed, while a small computer such as a Raspberry Pi can connect the camera and screen.

| Focus History       | Display previous sessions and progress                          | Should Have |

### Initial Computer Vision Scope

The first version will focus on a small number of detectable behaviors:

1. **Face Presence**

   * Detect whether the user is in front of the camera.

2. **Eye State**

   * Detect whether the user's eyes are open or closed.

3. **Head Orientation**

   * Estimate whether the user is facing the screen or looking away.

4. **Time-Based Focus Logic**

   * Avoid treating a single blink or short movement as a distraction.
   * Use the duration of a detected behavior before changing the focus state.

Additional features such as phone detection, yawning detection, or detecting another person may be considered for future versions.

# 5. Why We Chose This MVP

We selected FocusRobot because it combines several areas that our team wants to learn and practice, including Computer Vision, mobile application development, backend development, databases, hardware integration, and 3D printing.

The project also allows us to create a physical prototype that can be demonstrated during the final presentation rather than building only a software interface.

Although the project includes hardware and Computer Vision challenges, we can control the scope by starting with a simple robot consisting of a 3D-printed body, camera, small screen, and Raspberry Pi.

Another important factor was the opportunity to expand the project in the future. The initial MVP can focus on basic focus detection, while later versions could include additional Computer Vision features, improved personalization, more robot interactions, and additional customization options.

The idea also addresses a problem that is relevant to our target users: maintaining focus during study and work.

# 6. Challenges and Opportunities

| Area                 | Challenge / Opportunity                                                                        | Planned Response                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Computer Vision**  | Detecting focus accurately from camera information can be difficult.                           | Start with a small set of measurable behaviors such as face presence, eye state, and head orientation.  |
| **Hardware**         | Integrating the camera, screen, Raspberry Pi, and 3D-printed body may require experimentation. | Build and test each hardware component separately before integrating the complete robot.                |
| **Scope**            | Combining mobile development, CV, backend, and hardware can become too large.                  | Keep the MVP limited to the core focus session flow and simple robot interactions.                      |
| **Time**             | Hardware development may take longer than expected.                                            | Build the software and CV prototype first while developing the hardware in parallel.                    |
| **Gamification**     | Rewards can make the experience more engaging.                                                 | Implement XP/coins and a small number of customization items in the MVP.                                |
| **Future Expansion** | The robot can support additional capabilities later.                                           | Design the system so additional sensors, CV features, and interactions can be added in future versions. |
