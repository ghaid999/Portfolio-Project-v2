# FocusRobot — Project Charter

## 1. Project Objectives

### Project Purpose

FocusRobot is a physical robot paired with a mobile application that helps people maintain focus during study or work sessions. The robot uses a camera and Computer Vision to detect focus-related behaviors and provides real-time feedback. Users can also earn rewards for completing focus sessions.

The project aims to combine Computer Vision, mobile development, hardware, and gamification into a practical prototype that can help users build better focus habits.

## SMART Objectives

1. **Real-Time Focus Detection:** Build a robot that uses a camera and Computer Vision to detect whether a user is Focused, Distracted, or Away during a focus session. The system should identify the correct state in at least 80% of test cases across 5 different users. This should be completed during the development phase of the project, so users can become aware of losing focus and get back on track.

2. **Mobile App and Rewards:** Deliver a mobile app connected to the backend that lets users start and end a focus session with a timer, view a session summary (duration and percentage of focused time), and earn coins after each completed session, with all three core flows working without critical bugs before the integration phase ends. This gives users visible progress and motivation to keep building the habit.

3. **Integrated MVP:** Integrate the 3D-printed robot, Computer Vision module, mobile app, and backend into one MVP that completes a full session (start, detection, robot feedback, reward, progress view) in at least 9 out of 10 test runs, and reaches an average usefulness rating of 4 out of 5 from at least 5 test users by the end of the testing phase, followed by a live demo at the final presentation. This proves the concept works end to end and that users find it valuable.

## 4. Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk                               | Potential Impact                                                            | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Computer Vision accuracy**       | The robot may incorrectly detect whether the user is focused or distracted. | Start with simple and measurable behaviors such as face presence and head orientation. Test the system with different users and conditions. |
| **Hardware integration problems**  | Hardware issues could delay development and testing.                        | Use simple hardware components and test each component separately before integration.                                                       |
| **Limited development time**       | The team may not complete all planned features.                             | Prioritize the core MVP and implement additional features only if time allows.                                                              |
| **Integration between components** | The robot, mobile application, and backend may not communicate correctly.   | Define interfaces early and test communication between components throughout development.                                                   |
| **Limited hardware resources**     | The team may face limitations with available components or equipment.       | Build a simple prototype using readily available components and avoid unnecessary hardware features.                                        |
